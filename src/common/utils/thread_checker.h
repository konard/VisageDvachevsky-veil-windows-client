/**
 * Thread ownership checker for enforcing single-threaded access patterns.
 *
 * This utility class helps enforce the documented thread model by providing
 * runtime assertions in debug builds. When a ThreadChecker is created, it
 * records the current thread ID. Subsequent calls to check() will assert
 * that they are called from the same thread.
 *
 * In release builds (NDEBUG defined), all operations are no-ops with zero
 * overhead.
 *
 * Usage:
 * @code
 * class SingleThreadedComponent {
 *  public:
 *   void process() {
 *     VEIL_DCHECK_THREAD(thread_checker_);
 *     // ... component logic that must run on owner thread ...
 *   }
 *
 *  private:
 *   VEIL_THREAD_CHECKER(thread_checker_);
 * };
 * @endcode
 *
 * Thread Safety:
 *   This class itself is NOT thread-safe. It is designed to detect
 *   violations of single-threaded access patterns, not to protect against them.
 *
 * @see docs/thread_model.md for the VEIL threading model documentation.
